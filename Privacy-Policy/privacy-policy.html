      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        MetLab website is owned by MetLab, which is a data controller of your
        personal data. We have adopted this Privacy Policy, which determines how
        we are processing the information collected by metlab.com, which also
        provides the reasons why we must collect certain personal data about
        you. Therefore, you must read this Privacy Policy before using
        metlab.com website. We take care of your personal data and undertake to
        guarantee its confidentiality and security.
      </p>

      <h3>Personal information we collect:</h3>

      <p>
        When you visit the webapp, we automatically collect certain information
        about your device, including information about your web browser, IP
        address, time zone, and some of the installed cookies on your device.
        Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the
        individual web pages or products you view, what websites or search terms
        referred you to the Site, and how you interact with the Site. We refer
        to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
        Moreover, we might collect the personal data you provide to us
        (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address, payment
        information, etc.) during registration to be able to fulfill the
        agreement. Why do we process your data? Our top priority is customer
        data security, and, as such, we may process only minimal user data, only
        as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the website.
        Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential
        cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding website
        usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such

        visit the website without telling us who you are or revealing any
        information, by which someone could identify you as a specific,
        identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the
        website’s features, or you wish to receive our newsletter or provide
        other details by filling a form, you may provide personal data to us,
        such as your email, first name, last name, city of residence,
        organization, telephone number. You can choose not to provide us with
        your personal data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of
        some of the website’s features. For example, you won’t be able to
        receive our Newsletter or contact us directly from the website. Users
        who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to
